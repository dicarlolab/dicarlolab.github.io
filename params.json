{"name":"DiCarlo Lab Datasets","tagline":"Public Neural Datasets for Encoding Models","body":"### DLData Public\r\nIn order to stimulate the development of encoding models of visual cortex we have made several large scale neural datasets publicly available via a github repository. This site is intended to describe the format of those datasets, how to submit the predictions of encoding models, and how results will be calculated and posted.\r\n\r\n### Data format\r\nWe have modeled the format of the datasets after [skdata](http://jaberg.github.io/skdata/), a format for standard machine learning datasets.\r\n\r\nEach dataset is a python object which has attached\r\n\r\n+  images (as an [skdata lazy array](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/blob/master/skdata/larray.py))\r\n+  metadata about these images (as a [tabular array](http://web.mit.edu/yamins/www/tabular/modules/tabular.tab.html)) \r\n+  neural data (as a [numpy array](http://www.numpy.org/)), a vector of responses for each image\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nimport dldatapublic.neural_datasets as nd\r\ndataset = nd.PNAS2010()\r\nimages = dataset.images  #not yet loaded in memory\r\nim0 = images[0]  #loaded in memory as a numpy array\r\nmeta = dataset.meta\r\nprint meta['category'][0]  #'car'\r\nprint meta['obj'][0]  #'ferrari'\r\nIT_neural_features = dataset.IT_neural_features\r\nV4_neural_features = dataset.V4_neural_features\r\n```\r\nFor further documentation, see the tutorials folder. There is a short readme describing the nature of each dataset. Depending on the dataset, neural data is available at a finer grain than simply a vector of responses per image.\r\n\r\n### Submitting encoding models\r\n\r\n+  Clone and install the dldata_public repository\r\n+  Generate and save an array for one of the test datasets, the same shape as dataset.neural_features\r\n+  Submit a pull request\r\n\r\nWe require that the code used to generate predictions be made publicly available (on github or otherwise) so that others may run your model on similarly structured datasets. Once we verify these conditions, we will evaluate the models for their predictivity and post the results.\r\n\r\n### Results/Methodology\r\nYour predictions will be evaluated using a single-site % variance explained metric, as well as a population level representation dissimilarity metric. As an example, here are the results from the dataset used in our [PNAS 2014 paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/05/08/1403112111), where the methodology of these metrics is described.\r\n(Single site neural fit plot for V4 and IT neural data)\r\n\r\nThe results of predicting neural activity for all datasets in this repository are available [here](broken link).\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nFeel free to explore the data as you wish, but we ask that you contact us before publishing any analysis of this data. If you fail to do so, we reserve the right to contact journal editors and request a withdrawal.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any trouble installing or using the datasets, please contact ardila@mit.edu.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
