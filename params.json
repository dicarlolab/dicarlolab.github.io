{"name":"DiCarlo Lab Datasets","tagline":"Public Neural Datasets for Encoding Models","body":"### DLData Public\r\nIn order to stimulate the development of encoding models of visual cortex we have made several large scale neural datasets publicly available [here](http://github.com/dicarlolab/dldata). This site is intended to describe the format of those datasets, and the conditions that encoding models must meet in order to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n### Data format\r\nWe have modeled the format of the datasets after [skdata](http://jaberg.github.io/skdata/), a format for standard machine learning datasets.\r\n\r\nEach dataset is a python object which has attached\r\n\r\n+  images (as an [skdata lazy array](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/blob/master/skdata/larray.py))\r\n+  metadata about these images (as a [tabular array](http://web.mit.edu/yamins/www/tabular/modules/tabular.tab.html)) \r\n+  neural data (as a [numpy array](http://www.numpy.org/)), a vector of responses for each image\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nimport dldatapublic.neural_datasets as nd\r\ndataset = nd.PNAS2010()\r\nimages = dataset.images  #not yet loaded in memory\r\nim0 = images[0]  #loaded in memory as a numpy array\r\nmeta = dataset.meta\r\nprint meta['category'][0]  #'car'\r\nprint meta['obj'][0]  #'ferrari'\r\nneural_features = dataset.neural_features\r\n```\r\nFor further documentation, see the tutorials folder. There is a short readme describing the nature of each dataset. Depending on the dataset, neural data is available at a finer grain than simply a vector of responses per image.\r\n\r\n### Submitting encoding models\r\n\r\n+  Clone and install the dldata_public repository\r\n+  Generate and save an array for one of the test datasets\r\n+  Submit a pull request\r\n\r\nWe require that encoding models be available publicly (on github or otherwise), and that the code used to generate features be made public within that repository. Once we verify these conditions, we will evaluate the models for their predictivity and add their features to the python objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nYou are free to explore the data as you wish, but we ask that you contact us before publishing any analysis of this data.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any trouble installing or using the datasets, please contact ardila@mit.edu.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
